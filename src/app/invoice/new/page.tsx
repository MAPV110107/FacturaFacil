// This file (src/app/invoice/new/page.tsx) is a duplicate and was causing a build error
// due to "two parallel pages that resolve to the same path".
// Its content has been modified by the AI assistant to remove any default export,
// which should prevent Next.js from treating it as a page and resolve the error.
// The correct page component for this route is located at: src/app/(app)/invoice/new/page.tsx.
//
// IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO MANUALLY DELETE THIS FILE (src/app/invoice/new/page.tsx)
// FROM YOUR PROJECT to keep the codebase clean.

// Intentionally no default export to prevent Next.js from treating this as a page.
